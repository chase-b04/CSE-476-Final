# CSE-476-Final

Natural Language Processing Final Project

Hello, this is Chase Bulkin's agent. This agent utilizes Chain-Of-Thoughts, Self-Consistency, and Few-Thought-Prompting

Instructions:

1. Download the files and install the right frameworks and libraries
2. Replace the INPUT_PATH link on line 29 with your input questions json file.
3. Replace the OUTPUT_PATH link on line 30 with your output answers json file.
4. Run the program using python generate_answer.py
5. I did everything I could to make as fast as possible, but it could still take a bit depending on your questions set size. So while you're waiting, there will be a print statement that clearly shows you the file the question number, final answer, and the method the agent ended up choosing between the three.
