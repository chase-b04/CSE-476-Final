        "input": "The popular neighborhood known as the Tower District is centered around the historic Tower Theatre, which is included on the National List of Historic Places. The theater was built in 1939 and is at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of the Tower District. (The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area). The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno). In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District. When was the Tower Theatre built?"

After a change of personnel in April 1967, the band changed their name to \"Art\", and released the album \"Supernatural Fairy Tales\".  They also participated to a psychedelic bizarre album called \"Featuring The Human Host And The Heavy Metal Kids\" by a collective known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, formed by Guy Stevens and an influential British graphic design and avant-garde musical partnership between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth.  The musicians involved in that project were Mike Harrison on keys and vocals, Luther Grosvenor on guitars, Greg Ridley on bass and Mike Kellie on drums, as well as performances by Stevens, English and Waymouth.  It was the first time that the term \"heavy metal\" was ever used in music, even though that album had nothing to do with heavy metal music, being closer to psychedelic music.  That album was published in 1967 on Liberty Records and contained only five songs from two minutes to more than 15 minutes of psychedelic and almost meditative state kind of music. Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus: Vampirovibrio chorellavorus is a 0.6 µm pleomorphic cocci with a gram negative cell wall, and is one of the few known predatory bacteria.  Unlike many bacteria, \"Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus\" is an obligate parasite, attaching to the cell wall of green algae of the genus \"Chlorella\".  \"Vampirovibrio\" originates from the Hungarian words \"vampir\" meaning vampire (due to the nature of sucking out cellular contents of its prey) and \"vibrio\" referring to the bacterial genus of curved rod bacterium.  \"Chlorellavorus\" is named for the host of the bacterium (\"Chlorella)\" and the Latin \"voro\" meaning \"to devour\" (\"Chlorella\"-devouring). Orthodox Jewish feminism: Orthodox Jewish feminism (also known as Orthodox feminism amongst Jews) is a movement in Orthodox Judaism which seeks to further the cause of a more egalitarian approach to Jewish practice within the bounds of Jewish Law.

Lysin: Lysins, also known as endolysins or murein hydrolases, are hydrolytic enzymes produced by bacteriophages in order to cleave the host's cell wall during the final stage of the lytic cycle.  Lysins are highly evolved enzymes that are able to target one of the five bonds in peptidoglycan (murein), the main component of bacterial cell walls, which allows the release of progeny virions from the lysed cell.  Cell-wall-containing Archaea are also lysed by specialized pseudomurein-cleaving lysins, while most archaeal viruses employ alternate mechanisms.  Similarly, not all bacteriophages synthesize lysins: some small single-stranded DNA and RNA phages produce membrane proteins that activate the host's autolytic mechanisms. Donald C. Paup: Donald Clark Paup (April 2, 1939 – August 7, 2012) was an American badminton player who won national and international titles from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s.
