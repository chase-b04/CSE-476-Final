    "output": "The grass being wet suggests that water is present on its surface. Since the streets are dry, it is less likely that recent precipitation (like rain) occurred, as precipitation would typically make streets wet as well. Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air cools and changes into liquid form, such as dew forming on grass in the early morning. This explains why the grass is wet without the streets being affected."
